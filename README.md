TheRollingBall is an **augmented reality (AR) puzzle game** where players navigate a rolling ball on a 3D virtual cube. The cube has multiple platforms, obstacles, and moving slabs. Players must rotate the cube in real time to guide the ball through different challenges and reach the final goal.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time AR Interaction**: Move and rotate a physical 3D marker to control the virtual cube.
- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: The ball rolls dynamically based on gravity and cube orientation.
- **Challenging Obstacles**: Moving platforms, speed zones, and slow zones add complexity.
- **Checkpoint System**: Progress is saved at checkpoints to enhance playability.
- **Lives System**: Players must complete levels within limited attempts.
